P representing  as a circuit with logic gates eg. R(x) = x^3 + x +5 = 35 , wires here are operations sucahs as +/-/etc 
one equation per gate
Gate1 //  
Gate2
Gate3


So now we have a problem where a prover wants to prove that they have a bunch of x-a,y-b  and x-c values that satisfy a bunch of equations that are of the same form.

non-interactive zero knowledge proofs
which means that the proof itself is a blob of data that can be verified without any interaction from the prover.

//modern cryptography generally relies heavily on abstract algebraic structures and concepts.
